# zsh-perlbrew

## Overview

This zsh plugin installs perlbrew if not already installed,
defaulting to `$HOME/.perlbrew/perl5` or `$PERLBREW_ROOT` if
specified.

After ensuring that perlbrew is installed, it then initializes
perlbrew for use in the current shell.

I created this because I couldn't find another existing plugin
for this, and I want to reduce the amount of work to install
a zsh environment on a new system.

## Installation

Use your favorite zsh plugin manager to install this plugin.
